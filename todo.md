# Scope

* Present code (TG)

    ## Pending tasks:

    * Implementation:
        * Adapt code for sectional and total forces
        * Include stall corrections
    * Results:
        * Repeat NACA-2412 and NACA-4412 test cases
        * Present topologies with NLF x NACA 4 digit airfoils

* Present benchmark against full solution
* Airfoil optimization x wing optimization x airfoil in the loop
    * External optimization w/ gradient-free
